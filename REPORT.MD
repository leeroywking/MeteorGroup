# JS Framework Comparative Analysis

## Framework Name (Meteor)

### Research Conducted By: Austin Wood, Lee-Roy King, Alvian Joseph

### Overall Score and Comments
#### Score (Out of 10): 8
#### General Comments
If we were going to make a chat app, this would be the framework that we would use. Anything that heavily uses a database would do well with Meteor. 

#### Pros
* Strong native support for real time database connections. 
* Built in pub-sub that are straight forward and easy to use (if you read the documentation).

#### Cons
* Not intuitive state management for react apps.
* Limited to MongoDB for Database support. 

#### Documentation
Thoughts go here

#### Systems Requirements 
* MongoDB
* Minimal CPU/RAM
* Memory efficient (/w Mongo)

#### Ramp-Up Projections
It should only take a team of junior developers a few hours to get spun up on the docs and how everything interacts. After playing around with it for a couple hours we were able to make changes and accurately predict how the app would behave. 

#### Community Support and Adoption levels
Widely used, allows for quick deployment and management of full stack applications within the one framework.
##### Used by 300+ companies and 1000+ Developers
##### Meteor Integrates with: 
* Node.js
* React
* AngularJS
* MongoDB
* Webstorm 
* Select2 
* And many more!
